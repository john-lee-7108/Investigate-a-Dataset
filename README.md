# Investigate-a-Dataset
Udacity Project

This is my take on Udacity's Investigate a Dataset project. In this project, I analyzed a dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I demonstrated the use of Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. 

Hope this helps and let me know if I can improve on it more.
