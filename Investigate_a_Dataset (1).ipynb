    "    Hello, for this dataset investigation I am going to use the TMDb-movies.csv dataset. I want to look into certain factors that can help me identify correlation or trends that help make a movie a box office hit. \n",

    "    I would like to aim and answer these questions with this dataset investigation:\n",
    "        1. Which movie has the most budget? Did it translate to profits?\n",
    "        2. Which movie has the most revenue? Did it translate to profits?\n",
    "        3. Is there a certain actor/actress that is starring in profitable movies?\n",
    "        4. Is there a certain director that has directed more profitable movies compared to others?\n",
    "        5. How long should the movie be? Is the longest movie more profitable? \n",
    "        6. Is there a certain genre that outperforms the rest?\n",
    "        7. Overall which movie earned the most?"

These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report."
